# TarkovOCR
Optical Character Recognition for Escape From Tarkov that reads the item name and uses an API to lookup price info about the item.

This is my version of a much more popular and better project [Rat Scanner](https://github.com/RatScanner/RatScanner).

The same as [Rat Scanner](https://github.com/RatScanner/RatScanner) this uses OCR on screenshots to get the name, so it shouldn't be bannable because it's not accessing any memory which is typically used in game cheats. 
# Setup
